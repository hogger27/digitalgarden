A nation made of multiple kingdoms. The largest nation in size, the kingdoms work as separate forces but are all allies. For national decisions there may be a gathering at [[Unsorted/The Iron Spine\|The Iron Spine]], a mountain range acting as a border separating northern and southern Quantor. This is where all kingdoms gather to make decisions, for a summoning to occur all kingdoms must agree to the summoning.
