The Imoaline are the lowest class in [[Nations/Serpaline\|Serpaline]]. They are a majority of the population, around 50-60%. They are also known as "Slum Dogs." by those higher on the political ladder than them. The Imoaline are usually found outside of the capital in territories of the Serpaline, or in ran down sectors. Ten years ago in the year 556, [[Unsorted/The Great Slaughter\|The Great Slaughter]] occurred. A lot of the Imoaline died, and a lot of them had to rebuild. But the capital of [[Nations/Serpaline\|Serpaline]] still held tall, a symbol of the [[Unsorted/Sumaline\|Sumaline]]'s security.
