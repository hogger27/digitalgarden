Gods are separated into two classifications. Lower gods & higher gods. Lower gods are worshipped in smaller cults. They all have a mortal body, that can be vanquished, and are speculated to be potentially cultivated. Higher gods are only able to be felled by other higher gods, or be brought to their end through forgetfulness.
