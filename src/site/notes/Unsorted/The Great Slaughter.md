In the year 556, "The Great Slaughter" occurred. A unknown organization led a terrorist attack on the nation of [[Nations/Serpaline\|Serpaline]] & Quantor. Over the next 10 years, the Serpaline people suffered. Many poor territories of [[Nations/Serpaline\|Serpaline]] were bombed, many families villages were burned and scorched into ash, and a total of ten percent of the population died. Not one noble died however. Only those on the lower classes in [[Nations/Serpaline\|Serpaline]] died. [[Nations/Serpaline\|Serpaline]] never forgets, the years of rebuilding and the families that were torn apart.
